Unit testing is without any doubt a good way to minimize maintenance costs and risk of failures in production.
<br/>
However, it can get tricky especially when it comes to more complex systems. Probably you have heard some of the following sentences (...or even said them yourself):


* *The code as it is now works, I tested it over and over by entering multiple data sets*
* *We cannot write tests for that but we tested it manually*
* *After the latest change we deployed and got some error in production*
* *We can check the log files to see that everything is working*
<br/>


While unit testing is no silver bullet, it is still of great value. Pragmatic unit testing is a broad guide for both beginners and advanced developers.
<br/>
The books start with some basic startup topics as well as some general test principles such as FIRST, Right-BICEP, and CORRECT.
Thereafter, the author even illustrates how good unit testing can contribute to cleaner code and better design.
<br/>
Throughout the book the author uses one concrete application as the system under test which makes the different examples less abstract.
In conclusion, I find this book quite valuable for both getting started as well as reference for the daily work
