When humans are collaborating, there are quite a few aspects to consider. The main aspect in my opinion is that all people are different:


* Some are a bit more quiet, some are more talking
* Some are thinkers, some are doers
* Some might not feel comfortable talking in front of groups
* ...and some more


<br/>
These and other issues might lead to less efficient and even bad collaboration and results that are not that good.
<br/>
*Solve problems together*, by Marcus Degerman, contains a variety of ideas to achieve good collaboration, clear outputs and decisions. Apart from that 
Marcus presents hands-on advice on how to conduct meetings where people are heard, involved, focused and creative.
<br/>
Nicely written, concise and with practical information.
