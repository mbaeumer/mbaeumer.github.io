Getting things done and completing all the tasks on our to-do lists is probably a huge challenge for many people...including me!
The Pomodoro technique is one method that can be used for that. I will not go into very much detail about the technique, but here are some core ideas:


* Dedicate 25 minutes at a time for one (...and only) one activity
* Minimize distractions and disturbances
* Plan your activities, set priorities, so you work with the most important stuff first
* Keep track on your activities and your progress; it will help to get to know yourself better and to identify which things keep you from getting things done
* Run a daily retrospective about your activities and accomplishments


While I am not a Pomodoro evangelist I really like the technique itself. *Pomodoro technique illustrated* by Staffan NÃ¶teberg provides a very good introduction. 
The author does not only describe Pomodoro in theory, but also gives hands-on advice how to apply it in every day life. While reading the book I thought a couple of times 
*"Hey, I can instantly try this little tweak"*
<br/>
Personally, I like several parts of the book: One chapter describes in several short subchapters how the brain works, e.g. what causes stress, what makes us distracted 
and how we can minimize these issues. Another thing I like are the parallels to IT and software development, e.g. working in short cycles, getting continuous feedback and 
continually improving the way of working.
<br/>
To sum up I recommend this book to everyone who is in one way or another struggling with getting things done. As I said, I have not become an evangelist, but the book changed my mindset 
and my way of working.
