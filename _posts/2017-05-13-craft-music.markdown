In March and April I held two presentations in Gothenburg and Malm√∂ respectively. The topic was what software developers can learn from musicians.
In both cases the audience was interested and actively involved in exercises and discussions throughout the sessions. Nice!
<br/>
I had mainly two reasons to think about the topic: Personally, I believe that is worth once in a while to look behind the own plate. That is, have a 
look into other branches and industries to see how work is done and what we in IT can adopt.
Furthermore, the music business is an excellent example to show what is needed to succeed: courage, an open mind and the will to improve to name a few.
<br/>
Just have a seat and think for a couple of minutes what IT can learn from others!
