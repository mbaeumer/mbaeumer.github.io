Just a short note to myself on how to connect to hsqldb:<br/>

## The problem
In one JavaFX application I use hsqldb as database. Now I wanted to connect to that database from outside the application, simply to try out  some queries prior to implementing the fullstack feature.

## The resolution

# Download hsqldb.jar
Download using the maven dependency plugin

{% highlight bash %}
mvn dependency:copy-dependencies
{% endhighlight %}

# Start the Swing client

{% highlight bash %}
java -cp hsqldb.jar org.hsqld.util.DatabaseManagerSwing
{% endhighlight %}

...then use the following settings: <br/>
URL: jdbc:hsqldb:file:fxlink <br/>
User and Password: as configured <br/>

...and then you are done!
