Just a short note to myself on how to connect to hsqld:</br>

# The problem
In one JavaFX application I use hsqldb as database. Now I wanted to connect to that database from outside the application, simply to try out  some queries prior to implementing the fullstack feature.

# The resolution

## Download hsqld.jar
Download using the maven dependency plugin

{% highlight bash %}
mvn dependency:copy-dependencies
{% endhighligh %}

## Start the Swing client

{% highlight bash %}
java -cp hsqldb.jar org.hsqld.util.DatabaseManagerSwing
{% endhighligh %}

...then use the following settings:</br>
URL: jdbc:hsqldb:file:fxlink</br>
User and Password: as configured</br>

...and then you are done!
