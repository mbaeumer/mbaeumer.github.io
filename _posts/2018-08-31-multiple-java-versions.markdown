Since September 2017, the release cycles of the Java language have changed from two (or more) years to a period of six months.
This means that one probably needs to handle multiple versions of Java â€“ one for the current builds and one for builds running on future versions of Java.<br/>

This is a short guide (and reminder to myself) on how to easily switch between two or multiple JDKs using homebrew and jenv.

Originally, I installed Java without homebrew, so I started looking for a better setup of my environment.

## Step 1: Remove any JDK that is not installed using homebrew
First, I had to get rid of any JDK that was installed without homebre:
`sudo rm -rf /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines...`

## Step 2: Install cask
Homebrew is a package manager and cask is an extension of homebrew that lets users install even more applications.
`brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask`

## Step 3: Install jenv
jenv is a simple tool to manage multiple versions of the JDK. It can be installed using brew.
`brew install jenv`

## Step 4: Adding Git repository
Simply put, taps are repositories that are used by homebrew. Using the following command, a new reposiory is added for `caskroom/versions`.<br/>
`brew tap caskroom/versions` 

## Step 5: Install Java 8
Ok, right now there is no JDK installed. Now we can add new versions of the JDK using cask. Important here is that the oldest version is installed first.<br/>
`brew cask install java8`

## Step 6: Install latest Java
After the oldest version is installed, let's add the latest version.
`brew cask install java`
While writing this text, the latest JDK version was 10.

Step 7: Add the installed versions to jenv
Next, the installed JDK versions are registered in jenv so that jenv knows about all existing versions.<br/>
`jenv add /Library/Java/JavaVirt.../Contents/Home`

## Step 8: View the currently available JDKs
So now we can check which JDKs are available to jenv.<br/>
`jenv versions`. The output could look something like this:<br/>
```
  1.8
* 1.8.0.162 (set by /Users/martinbaumer/.jenv/version)
  10.0
  10.0.2
  oracle64-1.8.0.162
  oracle64-10.0.2
```
## Step 9: Switch JDK
For switching there are two different alternatives - either the version is changed globally or locally.<br/>
`jenv global <jdk-version>`
If global is used, the JDK version is updated for all paths. If local is used, the JDK version is set only for the curent working directory.
