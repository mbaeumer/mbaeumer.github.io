innovation + change

it is that time of the year again
When I started writing this little text, it was in the end of November, the days are quite short, it is dark when people off to work and when
they get home and the Christmas holidays are just around the corner. The same old game e very year.
Another thing that I experience regularly during that time of the year is that 
many people around me are coming up with new year's resolution. They often sound similar:
- I will do more training
- I will have a more healthy life style
- I want to have better grades
- I want to finish this or that
The list of such resolutions can be endless and I have probably made a whole bunch of them myself,
but honestly I never succeeded with any of them. 
Sounds familiar? Feel free to continue reading and maybe you reach to the same conclusion as I did.

Why do new year resolutions fail?
Bad timing.
Too positive reflection
Too enthusiastic
Vacation is there to relax
The now effect gets lost

What to do instead?
