		<h2 id="bs-spbia">Spring Boot in Action</h2>
		<p>Spring is a widely used application framework. However, configuring a Spring application can be pretty painful.
Spring Boot heavily simplifies the development by embedding a lot that is needed. It provides, for instance, a servlet container and
support for an easier configuration. These are only two essentials of Spring Boot</p>
		<p>"Spring Boot in Action" by Craig Walls is a good introduction. The author starts by highlighting what Spring Boot is and what it is not respectively.
After that, the reader can get started learning Spring Boot in a nicely structured way. Throughout the book, one application is developed
while various features of Spring Boot are explained and used.</p>
		<p>One thing I like much is that the author does propose different build tools (maven and gradle), so that the reader is not "forced" to follow
one way to succeed completing the different milestones.</p>
		<p>In the end, the author presents even different approaches to deploy the sample application to different cloud solutions. Again, the reader is not 
"locked" to one solution.</p>

		<h2 id="bs-solve-problems">Solve problems together</h2>
		<p>When humans are collaborating, there are quite a few aspects to consider. The main aspect in my opinion is that all people are different:
        <ul>
		  <li>Some are a bit more quiet, some are more talking</li>
		  <li>Some are thinkers, some are doers</li>
		  <li>Some might not feel comfortable talking in front of groups</li>
		  <li>....and some more</li>
		</ul>
		<p>		
		These and other issues might lead to less efficient and even bad collaboration and results that are not that good.
		</p>		
		<p>"Solve problems together", by Marcus Degerman, contains a variety of ideas to achieve good collaboration, clear outputs and decisions. Apart from that 
		Marcus presents hands-on advice on how to conduct meetings where people are heard, involved, focused and creative.
Nicely written, concise and with practical information.

	    <h1 class="title-parent">It is that time of the year again, and why I have given up on new year resolutions</h1>
		<p>When I started writing this little text, it was at the end of November. The days are quite short; it is dark when people are off to work and when they get home. The Christmas holidays are 
just around the corner. The same old game every year.</p>
        <p>Another thing that I regularly experience during that time of the year is that many people, including me, are coming up with new year's resolution. They often sound similar:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>I will do more training</li>
		  <li>I want to live healthier</li>
		  <li>I want to have better grades</li>
		  <li>I want to finish this or that</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The list of such resolutions can be endless, and I have probably made a whole bunch of them myself, but honestly, I rarely succeed with any of them. 
Sounds familiar? Feel free to continue reading and maybe you reach the same conclusion as I did.</p>
		<h2>Why do new year resolutions fail?</h2>
		<p>The reason for failing your resolutions is quite simple in my opinion:</p>
		<p><b>Bad timing!</b></p>
        <p>During the Christmas period, most people are stressed but also happy that the year is coming to an end. A lot of stuff has happened, we have worked hard, reached some goals and failed once 
in a while. When reflecting over the past year, I often find myself focusing on the positive stuff ignoring many of the difficult. While it is important to highlight and be proud of the 
accomplishments, it can also make me too ambitious and enthusiastic when I set goals for the upcoming year.</p>

         <p><b>Too much time</b></p>
         <p>Another reason why new year resolutions often fail is that they come with an "invite to procrastination": the new year has just started so there is plenty of time left to work on our goals 
so why should we start working on them right away? Probably you have heard yourself saying something of the following:</p>
         <p>"After the vacation, I will ..."</p>
         <p>By doing so, we give ourselves an excuse in advance for not reaching the goal.</p>

         <h2>So where to go from here?</h2>
         <p>Probably the most important lesson I have learnt during the past years is that vacation has a single and simple purpose:  To relax.
It is important to switch off for some time, recharge the batteries, dedicate the time to issues that fall a bit short during every day life:</p>
		 <ul>
			<li>family</li>
			<li>travelling</li>
			<li>getting back in touch with friends</li>
			<li>rest</li>
			<li>...and all the other things you never seem to take the time to do during your everyday busy life.</li>
		 </ul>
		<p>In other words, vacations are probably not the best time for making larger plans.</p>
		<p><b>Set shorter goals</b></p>
		<p>
		When it comes to setting and pursuing goals I started planning in shorter terms: In my experience, planning one month ahead seems good enough whereas planning longer periods feels a bit hard 
as I rarely know what happens three to four months from now. Planning maximum one month ahead helps me to get put things into action, to become more focused and motivated and to minimize the
risk to procrastinate. At the same time, keeping the scope fairly small makes it easier to react to unexpected circumstances.
		</p>
		<p><b>Take action</b></p>
		<p>
		The main reason for me to make new year resolutions was that I am not really happy with the status quo and I am already aware that we need to (...or should, or want to) change something.
Having this insight is good and essential. However, action needs to be taken to actually achieve some change. While I was earlier hiding all too often behind a new year resolution, 
I try to find ways to get started right away.
		</p>
		<p>
		Following this approach I reached a couple of goals throughout the year:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>I started a healthier life style: Better food and more sleep</li>
			<li>I teach myself Spring Boot in the context of a concrete software project. The result is already deployed in the cloud</li>
			<li>I completed reading four job-related books and gained lots of new insights</li>
			<li>I started learning python</li>
			<li>I even found the time to review a book written by a colleague</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		So, now it is that time of the year again: The days are quite short and the Christmas holidays are right around the corner. I still need to fix some tasks on my agenda (you know, the 
"usual suspects" that are probably on everybodyÂ´s todo list before the holidays). Then there will be some time to rest before I will aim for new stuff in January.
		</p>
		<p>What about you? Have you already thought about your plans for January?</p>
